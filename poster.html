        Goods and Sales Tax (GST) is a comprehensive, indirect tax levied on the manufacture, sale, and consumption of goods and services in India. It is a tax on value addition, meaning tax is levied on the difference between the price of the goods sold and the cost of production. GST replaces multiple indirect taxes previously levied on goods and services by the central and state governments.

      <div class="text">
        GST is classified into five different tax slabs, namely 0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%, depending on the type of goods or services being sold. GST is paid by the end consumer, and businesses can claim credit for the taxes paid on inputs used in the production of goods or services.

      <div class="text">
        It is important to be aware of the basics of GST to ensure compliance and avoid penalties. Businesses must register for GST if their annual turnover is above a certain threshold, and must file periodic returns and pay taxes due on time.
